Some notes to guide the conversation in Shaffer's group meeting for October 31, 2017.

## Some Machine Learning Vocabulary

### Some "types" of "Learning" Tasks
+ description
+ prediction 
+ clustering (figuring out what groups there are)
+ confirmation (statistical explanation)
+ interpretation (explanation in common sense)

+ classification vs. clustering
+ classification vs. regression


## Some Basic Thoughts on Natural Language Processing
### Why is language hard? 
A few top ones... you can think of more
+ context dependent
+ ambiguous
+ redundant (designed for errors)
+ multi-layered (syntax <-> semantics <-> higher level semantics)
+ many ways to say things

### Low level work operations
+ tokenization
