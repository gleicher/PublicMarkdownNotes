# Statistical Language Processing
Some notes to guide the conversation in Shaffer's group meeting for October 31, 2017.

## Some Machine Learning Vocabulary

### Some "types" of "Learning" Tasks / Models
+ description
+ prediction 
+ clustering (figuring out what groups there are)
+ confirmation (statistical explanation)
+ interpretation (explanation in common sense)
+ generative models (as generators, as predictors/classifiers)

+ classification vs. clustering
+ classification vs. regression


## Some Basic Thoughts on Natural Language Processing
Warning: I am not a language expert.

### Why is language hard? 
A few top ones... you can think of more
+ context dependent
+ ambiguous (at all levels)
+ redundant (designed for errors)
+ multi-layered (syntax <-> semantics <-> higher level semantics)
+ many ways to say things
+ reference to other things
+ other communications modalities (intonation, gesture, common reference)
+ reference to shared knowledge 

### Low level work operations
+ tokenization
+ standardization
+ lemmatization (remove endings)
+ stemming (as a subset of lemmatization)

### Some standard tasks
+ sentiment analysis

### Some basic strategies
+ Bag of words models
+ Bag of feature
